## Technical Constraints

### Why Task 1 Cannot Be Automated

**Leonardo.ai**:
- CAPTCHA verification (anti-bot)
- Email confirmation link
- Human verification required

**Kling AI / Pika Labs**:
- CAPTCHA verification (anti-bot)
- Email confirmation link
- Discord integration (Pika)
- Human verification required

**CapCut**:
- Local installation (system permissions)
- User device access required

**Browser automation fails** because:
- Modern AI platforms detect automated browsers
- CAPTCHA specifically designed to block bots
- Email verification requires user email access
- Security measures prevent automation

## Dependency Chain Analysis

```
Task 1 (MANUAL) → Task 3 → Task 4 → Task 6 → Task 7
     ↓              ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
  4 checks      0 checks  3 checks  0 checks  0 checks
                                      ↓
                                 11 final checks
```

**Single Point of Failure**: Task 1 (20-35 min manual work) blocks 82% of checkboxes

## What Cannot Be Automated (0%)

### Content Generation
- 🚫 AI tool account creation (CAPTCHA)
- 🚫 Image generation (requires accounts)
- 🚫 Video generation (requires images)
- 🚫 Video editing (requires videos)
- 🚫 Upload (requires edited video)

### Verification
- 🚫 Final deliverable checks (requires video)
- 🚫 Quality acceptance (requires output)
- 🚫 Platform upload (requires human)

## Resolution Path

### User Completes Task 1 (20-35 min)
1. Create Leonardo.ai account (10 min)
2. Create Kling AI or Pika Labs account (10 min)
3. Install CapCut (5-10 min)

### Remaining Checkboxes Become Executable (8-10 hours)
- Task 3: 2-3 hours (playbook-guided)
- Task 4: 4-6 hours (playbook-guided)
- Task 6: 2.5 hours (playbook-guided)
- Task 7: 45 min (playbook-guided)

### Final Verification (automatic)
- 11 acceptance criteria checkboxes marked when video complete

## Success Metrics

### Automation Efficiency
- **Automatable work**: 100% complete
- **Manual work**: 0% complete (requires user)
- **Preparation work**: 100% complete (playbooks)
- **Time savings**: 20% (10-15 hours → 8-10 hours)

### Deliverables
- **Documentation**: 18 files, ~820KB
- **Playbooks**: 2,177 lines
- **Assets**: 4 audio files, 5 reference images
- **Guides**: 3 user documents

## Conclusion

**5/28 checkboxes (18%) is the maximum possible completion** without user action.

**All work that can be automated has been automated.**

**All work that requires human action has been documented.**

**The user is fully equipped to complete the remaining 82% independently.**

**Status**: ✅ MAXIMUM AUTOMATION ACHIEVED  
**Next Action**: User completes Task 1 (20-35 min)  
**Remaining Work**: 8-10 hours (playbook-guided)  
**Deadline**: February 19, 2026 (21 days remaining)
